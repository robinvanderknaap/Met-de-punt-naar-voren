Met de punt naar voren - Theme for Orchard CMS
======================

This theme is specifically created for metdepuntnaarvoren.nl.

##Usage
- First download Orchard 1.5.1 (use the ZIP instead of WebPI download)
- Add the theme to the themes directory
- Start site
- Go through initial setup
- Disable module 'Comments'. Disqus comments will be used instead, this is already handled in the theme.
- Download 'Syntax Highlighter' module from the Gallery
- Download 'Designer Tools' module to make your life easier when altering the theme. Be sure to disable this module in production!

You are up and running. I prefer to disable all rich text editors, so you can just type plain html in an text area when writing blog posts.
